## Auto-Generated Files

After starting the project, the plugin will automatically generate files in the `src/router/elegant` directory. The files in this directory include auto-generated route imports, route definitions, and route conversion files.

## Configuration Properties

### 1. Type `RouteKey`

**Explanation:**

The union type `RouteKey` declares all route keys for easy and unified route management. This type is automatically generated by the [Elegant Router](https://github.com/mufeng889/react-auto-route) plugin based on the files under the `pages` directory.

### 2. Type `RoutePath`

**Explanation:**

The path of the route, which corresponds one-to-one with `RouteKey`.

### 3. Type `RouteMeta`

```typescript
// Interface for route metadata
interface RouteMeta {
  /**
   * Route title
   *
   * Can be used in the document title
   */
  title: string;
  /**
   * Internationalization key for the route
   *
   * If set, it will be used for i18n, and the title will be ignored
   */
  i18nKey?: App.I18n.I18nKey;
  /**
   * List of roles for the route
   *
   * The route is accessible if the current user has at least one role; if the list is empty, no permissions are required
   */
  roles?: string[];
  /** Whether to cache this route */
  keepAlive?: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether the route is a constant route
   *
   * Does not require login, and the route is defined on the front end
   */
  constant?: boolean;
  /**
   * Iconify icon
   *
   * Can be used in the menu or breadcrumb
   */
  icon?: string;
  /**
   * Local icon
   *
   * Located in the "src/assets/svg-icon" directory; if set, the `icon` property will be ignored
   */
  localIcon?: string;
  /** Order of the route */
  order?: number;
  /** External link for the route */
  href?: string;
  /** Whether to hide the route in the menu */
  hideInMenu?: boolean;
  /**
   * The menu key to activate when entering this route
   *
   * This route is not in the menu
   *
   * @example
   *   If the route is "user_detail" and this is set to "user_list", the "User List" menu item will be activated
   */
  activeMenu?: import('@elegant-router/types').RouteKey;
  /** By default, routes with the same path share a tab; if set to true, multiple tabs will be used */
  multiTab?: boolean;
  /** If set, the route will be pinned in the tab display, and its value indicates the pinned tab's order (the homepage is a special case and will automatically remain pinned) */
  fixedIndexInTab?: number;
  /** Route query parameters, if set, will be automatically carried as query parameters when navigating to this route via the menu */
  query?: { key: string; value: string }[] | null;
}
```

## Note

If you create a route page under the `pages` directory that you want to call elsewhere but not display in the menu, you need to set `hideInMenu: true` in the `meta` property.

```typescript
{
    name: '403',
    path: '/403',
    component: 'layout.blank$view.403',
    meta: {
      title: '403',
      i18nKey: 'route.403',
      hideInMenu: true
    }
}
```
