---

## October 2024

1. Sync the latest updates of `soybean`.

## September 2024

1. Improve the documentation of hooks.
2. Write some example components for usage.
3. Add support for passing a custom error boundary path in `react-auto-route` and improve it.
4. Combine the error boundary of the route and the error boundary before the route is loaded, adding logic to display error reasons in the development environment. Write annotations that can be used for monitoring and reporting.
5. Keep `request` (i.e., `axios`) in sync with `soybean`.
6. Update the README.
7. Fix the bug related to modifying the tab pages.
8. Optimize the cyclomatic complexity of `admin-layout`.
9. Fix the issue where tabs cannot be clicked on mobile devices.
10. Sync the `color` and `util` packages with `soybean`.

## August 2024

1. Improve the documentation for `useTableHooks`.

2. Remove the `toSorted` method from the routing system to ensure compatibility with more browsers.

3. Enhance the adaptation of `tab` on mobile devices in the documentation.

4. Improve and optimize the code for `simple-router`.

5. Refine the documentation for `router`.

6. Improve the footer of the documentation.
